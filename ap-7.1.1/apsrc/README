The Makefile in this directory runs dspwrap on all the Array Processing macros to
create the image files, C interface function files, and arrayproc.h.  A
make local_install (or make install) places these files in ../apbin, ../apcsrc, and
../src/lib/dsp respectively.  The documentation is also generated and installed
to ../apman.

Doing a make lean keeps the *.lnk files around so if you only update comments
(for documentation or C source), dswrap will not try to reassemble the macro.

Arrayproc.h is created by cat'ing arrayproc.h.header with the DSPAP*.h files
generated by dspwrap (interface function prototypes).
