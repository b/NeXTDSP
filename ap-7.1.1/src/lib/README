The Makefile in this directory creates the Array Processing C interface function
library by compiling the utility routines in the C source files in this directory
and the C interface function source files generated by ../../apsrc/Makefile
(in the directory ../../apcsrc) and placing all objects into libarrayproc.a.
If ../../apcsrc does not exist, ../../apsrc/Makefile is called to generate it.

Note that make local_install makes a debug version of the library (as does
make debug).

The dsp directory here contains arrayproc.h.  It is created by ../../apsrc/Makefile
and is here only as a convenience when linking the clone library
(e.g. cc -L../../src/lib -I../../src/lib).
