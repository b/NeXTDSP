Created on 3/16/90 by Julius Smith.

New features: 	(input) and (output) DSP address qualifier support and the
		-prefixAP option

The Makefile in this directory builds the dspwrap and dsploadwrap tools and installs
them to /usr/bin.  Their man pages are also installed - to
/usr/local/doc/dspwrap_proj/man.

The normal make targets are supported.  Make local_install as well as make debug
compile debug versions and attempt to link with a debug version of libdsp.
