.TH DSPBEEP 1 "3 Apr 1989" "NeXT, Inc."
.SH NAME
dspbeep \- synthesize a beep using the DSP and sound output

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdspbeep\fR 
[-l]
[-n nbuffers]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBdspbeep\fR program is the simplest test of the DSP's sound-producing
capability.  It produces a test sinusoid with frequency i*Fs/256, where Fs
is the sampling frequency (high or low), 256 is the length of the sine ROM
in the DSP, and i increments by 1 from 1 once each buffer.  (The buffer
size is 512 stereo audio samples, 256 per channel.)  The output amplitude
is 2^(-64), i.e., the maximum-amplitude sinusoid read from ROM is
right-shifted 6 bits before being output.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-l\fR
Select low sampling rate (22.05 KHz).  The default sampling rate is 44.1 KHz.
.IP \fB\-n\fR
Set number of 512-word buffers to output.  The default is equivalent to 
"-n 100".
