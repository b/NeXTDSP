/usr/lib/dsp/test/README

This directory contains examples of DSP test programs in the style used
to develop 

	(1) unit generators macros for the Music Kit 
	(2) array processing macros for non-real-time signal processing

Each test file contains a DSP assembly language main program which invokes
the macro under test, passing it pointers to test data.  The test file can
be assembled and loaded into Bug56, the DSP56001 symbolic debugger.
Single-stepping once through the macro will normally flush out any bugs in
the code.

IMPORTANT NOTE: In release 2.0, the default monitor load address is
changed.  This was discovered after the code-freeze deadline for
/usr/lib/dsp/.  Therefore, to use these examples with Bug56 requires
configuring it WITHOUT "Revision C" support.  This means changing
"REVCCHIP" to 0 in degnext.asm (distributed in
/NextLibrary/Documentation/Ariel/), and having an assembled degnext.lod in
your working directory.  That way, the default load address $80 used by the
examples will leave room for all of degmon.  Alternatively, you can change
the examples to start at location $96.  "Revision C" refers to the new
revision of the DSP56001 mask where they have introduced an illegal
instruction vector at the END of the host-command vector table, thus
forcing programs to start at location $40.  The initial '040 machines do
not have revision C DSP chips, but future machines probably will.

See the comments in the DSP source code for instructions on how to assemble
the code and run the DSP debugger.

HINTS:

	If you get assembly errors, search in the .lst file for "ERROR --".

	The "finish" button in Bug56 will finish DO loops as well as the
	current subroutine level.

	The SWI instruction can be used to halt your test program when running
	under Bug56.  It will cause an "unrecognized breakpoint" to occur, 
	passing control back to you.  A SWI is treated as a NOP while 
	single-stepping.

	The dspasm shell-script (in this directory) provides a convenient
	way to assemble your macros.  For example, "dspasm mk_ex1" will
	assemble example 1.  "dspasm -I/me/my_dsp_dir mk_ex1" will assemble
	example 1 and look in /me/my_dsp_dir for macros and include files not 
	found in the normal directories under /usr/lib/dsp.

	If you need to alter something under /usr/lib/dsp, create your
	own copy (e.g., via "cp -r -p /usr/lib/dsp /me; ln -s /me/dsp /dsp")
	and use the dspasml shell-script (in this directory) instead of dspasm.
